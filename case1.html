            <p>My team and I redesigned the Endangered Species
                International organization website in hopes that by
                providing our design solutions,  the ESI website will
                be in a more advantageous position to raise
                awareness of endangered species and funds to
                reduce their risk of extinction.</p>

                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> <br>
                The Endangered Species International (ESI) website is created to bring in updates and information on current/future projects to their audience. However, due to the outdated information and lack of transparency of the site, new visitors to the site are unsure if they can trust the organization.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Solution:</strong> <br>
                As a team, we saw an opportunity to update the current website that will provide updated information in a way that will attract users and lead them to make a donation to the organization.</p>

                    <strong>Research:</strong> <br>
                    <p>To begin our journey, we knew we had to do a lot of research about ESI, their stakeholders, and other related non-profit organizations. 
                    We first began with the information that was readily available to us, their website. 
                    Our team was able to get a better understanding of what their mission was and their actions to move towards completing their mission. 
                    We also tried to contact members of the organization directly, but was unable to receive a reply.
                    <br>
                    Once we got an understanding of ESI, our team created a survey to find potential stakeholders and donors. 
                    The survey had basic questions about demographics, but we mostly focused on questions about animals, the environment, and any previous experience with donating to similar causes. 
                    We narrowed the results to people who are passionate about animals and the environment, and was able to hold interviews with them about the ESI website. 
                    <br>
                    Here is our interview guide.
                    <br>
                    Questions for site users:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Which sites do you frequent the most?</li>
                        <li>What do you like about those sites?</li>
                        <li>What do you think this site (ESI) is for?</li>
                        <li>What sticks out to you the most about this site?</li>
                        <li>What is your first impression of this site?</li>
                        <li>What do you like about this site?</li>

                        <li>How would you change this site?</li>
                        <li>How likely are you to recommend this organization to a friend or colleague?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br>
                    <p>Tasks for site users:</p>
                    <br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>If you were to donate to this site, how would you go about doing so?</li>
                        <li>How would you listen to their podcasts?</li>
                        <li>Can you show me a photo from any of the photo galleries?</li>
                    </ol>

                    <br>
                    <p>We conducted a total of six interviews, but a lot of the responses we received were about how outdated the layout was, how uncomfortable it was to navigate the website, and how they were hesitant to trust the organization.</p>

                    <p>Our team then continued to do a competitor analysis with two direct and two indirect competitors to discover what made their organization successful. 
                        We found through the analysis that they made sure to emphasize their mission by making it known and visible to users as soon as the website loads. 
                        They also made sure that the design of their website never took attention away from their cause, but rather supported it.

                    Creating this user persona would later on help us focus the direction of our design and help us determine who our future stakeholders would be.

                    Taylor, like many young adults, is a very environmentally conscious person who believes that action speaks louder than words. 
                    He does all that he can to reduce his carbon footprint and to aid others in doing the same.</p>

                  <p><strong>User Flow:</strong> <br>
                  Since Taylor is someone who is active in this field and has a lot of passion for it, he would be someone that would definitely do his research and want his money to go toward a trustworthy organization. 
                  Keeping that in mind, we created a user flow of how Taylor would go about navigating and researching the ESI website before deciding whether he wanted to donate or not.</p>
                <img class="flow" src="images/Non Profit Org - User Flow.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Then based on what we know about Taylor, we created a chart of different features that should be required on the newly designed site. 
                    That list of features were then composed into a prioritization matrix to help us decide which features to focus on when designing.</p>
                <img class="features" src="images/Non Profit Org - Feature Prioritization.jpg" alt=""> 
                <img class="storyboard" src="images/Storyboard.png" alt=""> 
                <p>Once all of this information was finalized, our team created a storyboard to show how Taylor would encounter ESI and ultimately decide to donate to the organization. 
                    The storyboard combined with the user flow we created alowed us to visualize the complete journey of potential stakeholders, which helped us focus on the areas we need to improve to make their experience on the site as simple and visually appealing as possible.</p>

                  <p><strong>Sketches + Wireframes:</strong> <br>
                  Finally, we were able to get into the nitty gritty of designing the actual website for ESI. 
                    Before we could begin sketching out wireframes, we needed to get the informational architecture organized in a way that would make sense for site visitors and make the information easily accessible. 
                    We noticed that there was a lot of repetition of information on the current site, which made navigation difficult to understand and information harder to find. 
                    Through cardsorting, we were able to condense the menu and group information together.</p>
                    <img class="cardsort" src="images/Non Profit Org - Cardsort.jpg" alt="">
                    <p>Our team then continued on with creating a simple wireframe of how we thought the website should be designed. 
                        Since there were three members, we each designed a wireframe and then combined our ideas together to form one.</p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <div class="wireframes">
                        <div class="wire1"><p>Wireframe 1:</p>

                        <div class="wire2"><p>Wireframe 2:</p>
                        <img class="wireframe2" src="images/wireframe2.png" alt="">
                        </div>
                        <div class="wire3"><p>Wireframe 3:</p>
                        <img class="wireframe3" src="images/wireframe3.png" alt="">

                    </div>
                    <p>We iterated the lo-fi wireframe into a mid-fi prototype to get a better feel of how the layout would look and interact with visitors who visit the site. 
                    Then based on the desktop version we made, we created a mobile version of the site.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                  <p><strong>User Testing:</strong> <br>
                    The first round of testing was done after our mid-fi version of the website was completed. 
                    A total of three users tested the prototype. While we received a lot of good feedback, one of the issues we came across was that the donation button in the main navigation was not very noticeable. 
                    One user was unable to see it, and had to go through all the menu options to find the donations page.</p>
                <img class="mid-test" src="images/mid-fi test.png" alt="">
                <p>Since donations are vital for a non-profit organization, it would cause a lot of issues for both the organization and stakeholders if they were unable to successfully find the donation page and donate to the organization. 
                    To fix that issue, we made iterations to make the button stand out among the other menu options in the navigation.
                <br>
                Another issue we ran into was selecting the color palette of our website. 
                During the process of designing the prototype, there were comments about how the website would look fine with a gray-scale background (as in the mid-fi prototype) since the pictures were already vibrant in color. 
                At the same time, our team had colors selected for our style guide. 
                To see what was best for the website, we conducted an A/B test to see if users liked a gray-scale color scheme vs. a colorful one.</p>

                    Per results from our final A/B testing, we decided to go with the more colorful color scheme rather than a gray-scale. 
                    We then continued to build out the rest of our style guide, and used that to apply the different designs, fonts, and colors to our final prototype.</p>

                    Because we were limited in our time, we were unable to make all the changes and build out all the different pages we wanted. 
                    To further develop the website, we would like to build out the “Projects” portion of the website. 
                    It is very important that the organization continues to communicate with their donors about their work in the field, we feel that it is important to create a space to build trust with their donors through transparency in their work. 
                    We would also like to update the staff information page with current members of the organization and to create a page with educational resources, so students can learn more about protecting endangered species and the environment.

                    This project reminded us once again how important research is in understanding what both the client and stakeholders want. 
                    We, as UX designers need to thoroughly research the client, their stakeholders, and other competitors to be able to empathize with them and  design a website that fulfills everyone’s needs. 
                    This project also gave us the freedom to be more creative with our designs and ultimately build a website that we are very proud of.</p>
